// User can see tic-tac-toe grid, user can see result of plays
// User can click buttons/sections of grid to play a turn
// User expects correct play to register on grid, and for wins/losses to be shown
// User may or may not be playing against a computer
//
// I need a grid of 9 boxes in order to place the x's and o's (CSS Grid?, indv. sections?)
// I need to be able to place an x or an o in each section as each turn is played (buttons?/switch?)
// If I hide the images and then unhide them when a turn is played, they can appear in the boxes
// I need a way to recognize when a win or loss occurs (function)
// I need a way to alert the result of the game to the user (alert)
